# Containerized App Scalability with AWS ALB Demo
Welcome to the Containerized App Scalability with AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) Demo! This project is designed to walk you through the journey of developing a swift application, containerizing it with Docker, and highlighting the transformative impact of an AWS Application Load Balancer on enhancing application scalability.

## Overview
In this demonstration, we will cover the essential steps to build and containerize a high-speed application. The focus then shifts to deploying the application initially without a load balancer and subsequently introducing the AWS Application Load Balancer to illustrate its significant role in scaling and optimizing application performance.

Explore the seamless integration of Docker and AWS ALB, and witness firsthand how these technologies work together to create a robust and scalable infrastructure for your applications.

## Building a Simple IP Display App with FastAPI
In this demonstration, we'll cover the process of creating a basic FastAPI application that serves to display the server's IP address. This app will later be utilized to illustrate the functionality of an application load balancer.

## Dockerizing an App with Dockerfile
Welcome to the Dockerizing an App demo, where I'll guide you through the steps to create a Dockerized image using a Dockerfile. Follow these instructions to build the image and feel free to pull the repository to try it yourself.

In this demonstration, we'll cover the essential steps to containerize an application using Docker. Containerization with Docker allows for a consistent and portable environment, making deployment across various platforms seamless.

## Registering Dockerized Image in Elastic Container Registry
Welcome to the demo on registering a Dockerized image in Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Follow these steps to create a repository in ECR and push your Docker image. Feel free to pull the repository and try it out yourself.

In this demonstration, we'll walk through the process of setting up a repository in Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and pushing a Docker image to it. ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

## Deploying Dockerized Image as a Service in Elastic Container Service
Welcome to the demo on deploying a Dockerized app as a service in Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). In this session, I will guide you through defining the container as a task definition and launching it on a Fargate cluster. Initially, we won't use a load balancer, allowing you to appreciate the importance of load balancing in a later step.

In this demonstration, we'll cover the essential steps to deploy a Dockerized application as a service using Amazon ECS. By defining a task definition and launching it on a Fargate cluster, you'll gain insights into managing containerized applications in a scalable and efficient manner.

## Deploying Dockerized App Behind the Application Load Balancer
Welcome to the demo on deploying a Dockerized app behind the Application Load Balancer (ALB) in Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). In this session, I will guide you through building an Application Load Balancer and deploying your app behind it. 
This demo illustrates how the Application Load Balancer enhances the scalability and availability of your application.

In this demonstration, we'll extend the capabilities of your Dockerized app by deploying it behind an Application Load Balancer. The ALB ensures even distribution of incoming traffic, improving scalability and providing high availability for your application.
